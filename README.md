# CNN-for-Sentence-Classification-keras
Realize paper written by Yoon Kim-Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification</br>
**Codes reference:https://github.com/alexander-rakhlin/CNN-for-Sentence-Classification-in-Keras**</br>
***
Codes written bt alexander-rakhlin don't use the word2vector,and he adjusted the structure to make the model perform better.</br>
This codes have been added word2vector(trained by Google,you can download it from **https://pan.baidu.com/s/1_8QI62YAu5TSGnxY4-5zEQ**)</br>
